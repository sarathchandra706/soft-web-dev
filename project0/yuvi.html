        <p style= "font-style = Arial;">Yuvraj Singh (born 12 December 1981) is a former Indian cricketer who
         played internationally in all forms of the game. An all-rounder who bats left-handed in the middle order and bowls slow left-arm
          orthodox, Yuvraj is the son of former Indian fast bowler and Punjabi actor Yograj Singh.[1] One of the greatest limited over
          players to play for India, Yuvraj was particularly noted for his aggressive stroke play of the ball and his fielding.Yuvraj
          was a member of the Indian cricket team in One Day Internationals (ODIs) between 2000 and 2017 and played his first Test
          match in October 2003. He was the vice-captain of the Indian ODI team between 2007 and 2008. He was the Man of the Tournament
          e 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, and one of the top performers at the 2007 ICC World T20, both of which India won. In a match against
          England at the 2007 World T20, he famously hit six sixes in one over bowled by Stuart Broad â€” a feat performed only three times
          previously in any form of senior cricket, and never in an international match between two teams with Test match status. In the
          same match, he set the record for the fastest fifty in Twenty20 Internationals and in all T20 cricket, reaching 50 runs in 12
         balls. During the 2011 World Cup, he became the first player to take a 5-wicket haul and score a 50 in the same World Cup match..</p>

       <p style= "font-style = Arial;">Yuvraj had a dream run at the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, where he scored 362 runs including one
        century and four fifties, took 15 wickets, won four Man of the Match awards, the joint-most along with Sri Lanka's Aravinda 
        de Silva in 1996 and South Africa's Lance Klusener in 1999, and was also adjudged the Player of the Tournament. In the process,
         he became the first allrounder to score 300-plus runs and take 15 wickets in a single World Cup. In India's match against 
         Ireland, he became the first player to take 5 Wickets and score 50 runs in a World Cup match. He also took his 100th ODI wicket
          with the dismissal of Wesley Barresi in the World Cup match against the Netherlands. He later took 2/44 and scored 57 runs 
          against defending champions Australia in the quarter finals, earning him the Man of the Match award.
Yuvraj had respiratory difficulties through 2011 and in May he withdrew from the ODI series in the West Indies due to an illness.
 His issues began with breathing difficulties, nausea and bouts of vomiting blood. He toured England but had to return home after
  breaking his finger in the Nottingham Test and later played two home Tests against West Indies. However, he then pulled out of the
   ODI series against West Indies in November citing an abnormal tumor in his lung. Yuvraj had originally targeted the CB series in
    Australia for his return to international cricket.</p>
